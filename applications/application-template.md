### Project Details

Digital Galaxy is a collaborative platform that provides both creators and collectors with the best possible experience. We are a home base for those that seek to discover digital cultures.

Conception

After 3 years in the NFT world, we no longer wanted to eat what was served on the plate. After recognizing numerous areas of improvement in existing marketplaces, the idea of the Digital Galaxy was birthed. The beauty of DG is that we aren’t a billion-dollar entity chasing the hot new thing. Our team is made up of creators and collectors, who have experienced both joy and pain in their NFT adventures. We are here to expand on the positives and eliminate the negatives. This will allow our community to have an enjoyable journey when pursuing their passions and hobbies.

### Ecosystem Fit

> 1. Where and how does your project fit into the Proton ecosystem? NFT Marketplace - building a full marketplace for all digital assets
> 2. Who is your target audience? blockchain technology, Crypto, gaming, devs and NFT lovers
> 3. What needs does your project meet for the community and what sets it apart from other similar projects? We are driven by providing the best user experience for buying and selling digital assets, experience across different chains buying and selling NFTs we see a massive gap in Proton lacking.   We can ddrive new creators and buyers to Proton and being the only marketplace pushing $XPR as a token we get it used what it is for. Payments.

Team: Core Team - Danny, Alan, Naden, Mike / Contractors - Hein (UI) and Lee (Developer)

Meet the core team:

Danny Marshall:
Over 15 years in the IT Recruitment Financial Services space and running my own recruitment businesses for many years. Been in crypto since 2017 on and off but been really focused since Jan 2021. Joined the Proton community around August 2021. Jumped straight into buying $XPR and NFTs, helped projects from Fennecs, GGIP, Peculiars and Spikes. Gained a good name in the community and decided I wanted to build something from the start and build something amazing. Spoke to Alan and Naden then Digital Galaxy was created.  

Alan Tobin:
Digital Design Engineer of 23 years using Autodesk Products 
Educated to Masters Degree level 
Gamer since the zx spectrum console in the 1980s 
Constructing digital twins before the metaverse had a name. Google HQ in London is an example of a major project experience. 
I have a family history in engineering and problem-solving  
I have been in the community since October 2021 learning where I fit into this space.  
Volunteered on the Metatron project, helping with everything from Socials, community, and building games in The Sandbox.

Naden Wright:
For 15 years I have worked as a sports and leisure coordinator and manager for the government of Gibraltar. Started trading crypto in 2017 and then moved on to building a passion for the digital world after discovering Proton in 2020. From investor, I then moved on to helping various nft projects such as Fennecs, GGIP and Spikes. Throughout my journey on Proton, I have gained a lot of experience and made some very good friends. These connections brought to me the digital galaxy team, where we all work hard towards one common goal, bringing digital assets to the forefront of the proton ecosystem.

Mike Messenger:
9 years of Retail Banking experience, followed by 5 years working in process improvement and software development build & testing, with a focus on user experience. I love learning, I do it quickly, can adapt to change just as quickly and try to focus on speed, efficiency, and quality. I got into crypto properly around 18 months ago and found Proton and its community soon after. In that time, I believe I’ve built a solid name within the community, always out to support people and projects, and have an NFT collection of my own and a lot of ideas for the future of the NFT space to help support adoption.

We saw a gap in the market and what people wanted plus needed to make the next step for proton nfts. We are passionate about proton and nfts to take it to the next level.
