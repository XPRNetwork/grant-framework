> **FreeHumans.World** is an open-source network created by the people for the people, with a sustainable tokenomics long term, based on multiple real utilities.
> The Gratitude Token (GRAT) is a currency that is used firstly to continuously self-distribute all the value generated by the network of users uniformly and globally, due to our unique Share2Earn and Like2Give algorithms + other amazing features that will be available for all users for free.
> 
**Background Story:**
> Lucian Apetrei, a Romanian tech visionary, boasts over 16 years of experience in web development and marketing R&D. He has quietly tackled multi-million dollar problems for IT companies, either as an innovation-obsessed employee or a consultant (B2B), with sustained engagements at IBM, 888 Holdings, Ipsos, Svea Finans, Humans.ai, and other prominent firms. His journey into sustainable tokenomics R&D commenced in 2017.
> 
> After many hundreds of regular web/mobile projects and solutions delivered for clients or for fun, having invested well over 200K euros from his own pocket just in the blockchain space, Lucian has built plenty of diverse projects and deepened his knowledge in blockchain, crypto, efficient markets, and economics. Notably, he created dozens of trading bots of Forex and Crypto for clients and out of a passion for learning new technologies. He deployed and managed a leading mining pool for Electroneum coin, fostering a community of 1800 Discord members at its zenith. Constructing a mining farm from scratch with 108 graphic cards + 13 ASICs further enriched his understanding of PoW algorithms, though he later divested, disillusioned with PoW principles.
> 
> Two years ago, Lucian made the pivotal decision to depart his corporate role and establish GratitudeToken.world. Utilizing FFF funds (Founders, Family, Friends), he assembled a team, endeavoring to forge a true Web 3 protocol or platform where decentralization of value and knowledge could thrive.
> 
> During the blockchain testing phase for GratitudeToken.World approximately 2 years ago, Lucian encountered challenges in finding a mature, actively developed blockchain solution. However, the discovery of XPR chain a year ago presented a fortuitous breakthrough, offering a perfect blockchain solution. Despite this, a crucial problem persisted: the absence of useful data or tools to model and predict tokenomics evolution. To address this gap, Lucian developed innovative visualization tools, showcased at https://w3x.info/simulation.html (visit and click Web 3 button, then Simulate btn), allowing simulation of value distribution among diverse user networks across Web 2 and Web 3 models or systems with varying tokenomics parameters.
> 
**What is FreeHumans.World again?**
> It's an open-source dApp, a gamified and decentralized social network that runs a tokenomics model similar to what a UBI (Universal Basic Income) system would be, but much more awesome than that.
> The code is licensed under GPL 3.0 open source license.

**The Problem:**
> The current social platforms (Web 2 "social" media) operate within centralized, hierarchical models that concentrate power and wealth, limiting democratic participation and equitable wealth distribution among users.
> In other words, they are exploiting us, censoring us, keeping us in echo chambers, and controlling the narrative while shoving ads that we don't care about in our face. The Netflix documentary "The Social Dilemma" is a must-watch on this topic.
> 
> Gen Z and younger are not creating Facebook and other Web 2 accounts anymore. Unfortunately, because the world economy relies on their advertising service, this produces socio-economic effects in the global economy akin to a cardiac arrest in a sanguine system and there is no viable real Web 3 alternative or safety-net.
> 
> These Web 2 platforms have become too cluttered and they lack mechanisms for genuine user engagement, ownership, and value creation, leading to a digital ecosystem dominated by a few entities and algorithms, where user contributions are undervalued and users are treated as products for an end result (conversion) that today has become very expensive due to saturation (according to the Metcalfe‚Äôs law problem). In other words, with the exception of TikTok (which is a short-form video platform, not a universal content platform), almost all Web 2 platforms have a very poor conversion rate (offering very expensive exposure to users through traditional saturated Web 2 advertising systems).
> 
> Data indicates that the post .com bubble or the Web 2 bubble has popped. We have seen massive layoffs and revenue drops in these companies. AI & blockchain is leveling the playing field once again as startups are figuring out what Web 3 looks like. The last time this happened was when Search and Social Media killed Yahoo, the biggest web company in the Web 1 era.

**The Solution:**
> FreeHumans.World introduces an alternative, a new Web 3 social network (dApp) that integrates gamification, blockchain, and AI technologies to redefine digital socio-cultural ecosystems and exposure markets (NFTs with real utility and regular markets similar to ebay.com - priced in XPR coin and GRAT token). Up to 99% of the GRAT token will be distributed for free to users on signup. The dApp aims to democratize digital engagement and ownership through decentralized governance and non-discriminating instant participatory economics.
>
> The platform employs new algorithms backed by Gratitude Tokens ($GRAT) to innovate economic exchange, enabling users to earn through various forms of digital engagement and to use tokes for more exposure to the network. It emphasizes authenticity and security with Quantum Resistant Encryption (SSS) and a unique, invite-only membership model. This approach seeks to shift from centralized control to a decentralized, equitable, and participatory model, fostering a digital environment where community, creativity, and democratic values thrive.

### Ecosystem Fit

1. Where and how does your project fit into the XPR Network ecosystem?
> **FreeHumans.World** aims to increase the number of accounts on XPR network dramatically. The market size for our target audience is around 3 billion people. We will accept XPR as the only other currency alongside the GRAT token in the 2 markets of the dApp. It is hard to calculate the huge impact that it will potentially have on the blockchain adoption, XPR price and awareness of the XPR network. One thing is for certain, it will not be a small impact.

3. Who is your target audience?
> Our main audience in the first phase of marketing and adoption is Generation Z and younger (people up to 26 years old), but also Millenials and others. They total about 3 billion real human beings that can potentially be empowered by becoming a FreeHumans.world user (that's also the same number of gamers in the world). The scalability for this project is huge and our marketing strategy ensures we will get a lot of users fast. This is because each new user must recruit 2 other unique humans in order to get the reward and you cannot trick the system with fake accounts. Read the Business Plan linked at the top for more details about our "Power of 100 - exponential marketing strategy" and how we are using advanced face identification technology to prevent bots or fake accounts.
> 
3. What needs does your project meet for the community and what sets it apart from other similar projects?
> - First, there is no other project like this in the XPR community, if there was I would love to contribute and collaborate. There are some basic similarities of the social app category, maybe with snipverse, but our decentralized user-driven and user-centric features and Web 3 decentralized business models are very different and create a different animal.
>
> - Secondly, we will not sabotage the project by selling most of the supply to investors like most ‚Äúpizza tokenomics‚Äù projects did. About 90% of the total supply of 12B tokens will be distributed exponentially to 1.67 Billion users initially, hopefully we can double this over the years. Our token distribution strategy starts with 100K GRAT tokens distributed to each of the 100 very serious and involved early adopters (the first 100 users). The reward halves for the next wave of users just like in mining. The condition for these users to get the reward is to recruit 2 new others users each and you cannot trick the system with multiple accounts. Our exponential marketing strategy theoretically can multiply this to 1.67 Billion users in 24 days, each new wave of invites will be doubling the number of users the next day (next wave). Read about "The power of 100 - Exponential marketing strategy" in our Web 3 business plan linked at the top.
> 
> - Thirdly, we are not asking for money from investors first and promising to deliver utility and services later, we believe in value first, monetization later. So the listing of our GRAT token will only happen once we have enough users to sustain a balanced demand and supply on the exchanges and the users will be the ones to sell, but also the ones to buy it back as they will continuously need it to participate in all the utilities the dApp will provide for users, all paid with GRAT token, while the Markets will also accept XPR coin.
> 
> The main value propositions are:
> - **Autonomy** *(we do not control or regulate any important aspect for access to content, content visibility or recommendation, the users do, live up-voting or down-voting in a democratic manner)*
> - **Individual and Collective Ownership** *(individual rights to the content created by each user with the option to make the IP available to everyone in the spirit of open-source)*
> - **Free active shares** *in the project through receiving GRAT tokens on signup or through multiple gamified mechanisms later*
> - **Trade GRAT tokens for Exposure or vice versa** *(Share2Earn algo enables organic post boosting; people earn a dynamic and fair amount of those tokens by distributing your boosted post to their connections, no other social app does Sharing like this)*
> - **Free Instant Crowd-funding** *for posts (Like2Give algo means you instantly earn tokens when anyone likes your content, Likes are not just for vanity)*
> - **Quantum Resistant Security** *(through SSS - Shamir Secret Sharing scheme)*
> - **Community Governance** *(the community has a say in the direction of the dApp, unlike Facebook or others where the "Community Guidelines" are a lie)*
> - **Quality Organic Engagement** *(since all users are real and unique human beings)*
> - **Gamified experience** *with multiple reward types that give real benefits like new abilities, achievements, titles, NFT items with real benefits or decorative NFT items*
> - **User created NFT items** *- Any user can create NFT items as easy as posting an image*
> - **Markets** *for NFT items and regular items (eBay like but priced in GRAT and XPR)*

> 
> This is our mission, our passion, and our commitment, with or without external support. We invite you to be part of this transformative journey.
>
> **Join us! We would love for the XPR team to collaborate with us on this gamified adventure. Web 2 is boring and deprecated, let's be the first to make it better. Together, we can go further than any one individual can imagine.**

> *P.S. Today it's my birthday and I am staying at home instead of going out with my friends. I have nothing to celebrate until this project is launched and available for all humans everywhere.*
