### Project Details

EasyEscrow is a trustless smart contract escrow platform being built on the Proton Blockchain. 
We are developing a self-contained platform, and then we are breaking it out into 5 separate open source escrow modules that anyone can work into their existing project. 

Our 5 types of escrow are as follows. 
1)	Crypto Exchange – this is an interface with a smart contract where user1 selects a token and corresponding quantity in their webauth wallet, and then proposes an exchange with user2. If user2 accepts the exchange the agreed upon tokens will move from the smart contract to user2’s webauth wallet. 
2)	Crypto Gift / Crypto Will – in the module user1 can select any token in their wallet and send it into a smart contract and select a future date and time for it to be delivered to user2. If the contract is not canceled prior, the smart contract will move the tokens into user2’s webauth wallet as the pre-designated date and time. 
3)	Purchase an Item – This module allows for a trustless way to complete a purchase safely and securely and release payment either immediately, or on delivery of the product. User1 has the ability to upload 10 images of the item they wish to purchase from User2. User1 would then select if they want the funds to go to user2 upon agreement, or if they want the funds to transfer upon confirmed delivery (when shipped or when delivered for example). User2 has the ability to then either accept or negotiate the purchase price. If negotiated, user2 will enter a new price and user1 would then either accept or negotiate, until a price is agreed upon. 
4)	Purchase a Service – Purchase a service functions in the same manner as purchase an item, but with a service such as someone that wants to purchase a website design or a logo design, or any other service. User1 and user2 can upload images and negotiate price and terms. 
5)	Pool / Contest – this trustless mechanism allows for multiple users to enter into a pool or a contest, with each of them entering a pre-determined number of tokens, designated by user1. User1 sets the parameters of the pool and the end date to enter. For example, a pool could be to guess the date of a child’s birth with 50 people entering the pool for 10 XPR each. The closest to the date would get all of the XPR in the smart contract pool. Or another example would be a football pool or any situation where multiple users would want to keep their money in escrow in a smart contract and not be worried about being paid. 

The current state of the platform exists at EasyEscrow.io. 
We have been in development of the platform on and off for about 12 months. 
We believe escrow smart contracts will play a huge role in bringing blockchain to the mainstream in real estate, contracts, and finance. We believe in the fast and free Proton blockchain vision. 


### Ecosystem Fit

1.	Where and how does your project fit into the Proton ecosystem? Our project fills a needed hole in the ecosystem for users wanting to buy, sell, or trade safely and securely on the blockchain. 
2.	Who is your target audience? The target for our closed platform would be current Proton users that wish to transact safely in a smart contract escrow environment with each other through OTC, product sales, gifts, or selling services. The target for our open source modules would be devs that wish to integrate escrow contracts into existing platforms for real estate, title agencies, or just to add an easy to use way to transfer money upon product or service approvals into an existing dapp. 
3.	What needs does your project meet for the community and what sets it apart from other similar projects? There is a need to transact with one another in a peer to peer fashion without worrying about someone stealing or not performing an agreed upon task. These fears can be alleviated with the escrow smart contracts we have been developing.

### Roadmap

> Our roadmap for Easy Escrow consists of 2 Milestones over a 2 month period, which will allow us to complete the existing project, advertise, and move forward with the open source modules.  

### Milestones

**Milestone:** 1
**Estimated duration:** 1 month
**FTE:**  5
**Costs:** 36,000 USD

to include $32,000 in development costs and $4,000 in advertising with emphasis on Proton Blockchain. This cost is inclusive of all past and prior website, coding, and smart contract work. 
- 1a. License – We intend to release under the MIT
- 1b: Documentation – we will include documentation on how to use the product and the tokenomics on the website for the closed end product. Api documentation delivered in the Repository ReadMe along with installation and use examples.
- 1c: Front end – Interface delivery and login functionality will be delivered in the Repository 
- 1d: Back end – The majority of the development work and smart contract work is complete and we are currently in the testing phase. 
Milestone 1 to be considered complete with a fully functioning platform with the 5 escrow types. Independent operation of separate modules to be completed in MS2

**Milestone:** 2
**Estimated duration:** 1 month
**FTE:**  2
**Costs:** 12,000 USD

to include $8,000 in development costs and $4,000 in advertising, with emphasis on Proton Blockchain
- 2a: Completion and full testing of the UX / UI with an example website online. 
- 2b: Proton Webauth integration is complete and functionable with all 5 escrow types without requiring all to be installed. 
- 2c: Complete the separation and independent operation of the 5 escrow types such that they are installable independently. 
- 2d: Create installer script to lower the bar for installation by developers.
Milestone 2 to be considered complete when all 5 escrow modules have been split and are running independently, and are open source, with full documentation, available to the public. 



### Future Plans

How do you intend to enhance, promote and support your project in the future? Our team is full-time and growing. We are builders and we are constantly improving our platforms and adding more services and better functions. We plan to release our closed end platform and begin immediately advertising it through paid socials, with the goal of bringing thousands of users into the Proton ecosystem. 4 weeks later we will release our open source modules and promote those to developers. We plan to continue to build on Proton and support our products and services. 

### Additional Information

We have never received a grant from Proton in the past. We are actively involved in the Proton community and believe in their vision for mainstream adoption. We currently run 3 metal nodes, run 3 dedicated servers, and have built a loan liquidator bot. We are actively working on an airdrop platform, a staking platform, and a token creation platform. We have plans after that for a web3 photography site and a travel site, both on Proton blockchain. We will then use the smart contract knowledge from these platforms to integrate into our real estate search platform.
