### Project Details

The cryptocurrency world has seen an enormous number of scams and hacks, and it is likely that the years 2021 and 2022 will be remembered for the significant amount of money lost as a result of smart contract exploits, hacks or frauds in general. As cybersecurity professionals, we realized that
we could not remain passive and had to take action by raising an awareness. This led us to develop a DNS service that can provide security for all crypto communities.

**What is DNS?**

The Domain Name System (DNS) plays a crucial role in connecting domain names to IP addresses, which are used to load internet pages. DNS servers make it possible for people to use normal words in their browsers instead of IP addresses. Our ProtonDNS service is entirely free, and it shields users
from known threats by blocking domains and attacks on their infrastructure. The service is continuously updated by Alvosec Threat Intelligence team using our global insight and observation of the threat landscape.

**Features**

ProtonDNS provides real-time security information to stop malicious activity on the network across all devices. Our threat intelligence system offers various forms of protection for all users and includes features where access is restricted, such as:

- malicouse websites
- phishing websites
- domains that host ransomware
- annoying ads
- typosquatting domains
- websites that are deceptive or fraudulent
- most abused TLDs (*.tk, *.ml)
- fake crypto exchanges
- fake antivirus domains
- cryptojacking domains
- newly registered domains
- wallet drainers
- adult content
- and many more...

Each list is regularly updated and reviewed to avoid false alarms. ProtonDNS supports DNSSEC technology which allows you to verify the authenticity of the stored DNS records with a digital signature. We also implemented DNS over HTTPS (DoH) protocol for performing remote Domain Name System (DNS) resolution via the HTTPS protocol.

**ProtonDNS web application and current features**

The website includes a functionality that verifies whether the user is connected to our DNS, which is exclusively accessible to individuals who authenticate into the web application using the WebAuth wallet.

Once the user has successfully authenticated, they will be able to navigate to the settings page where they can access multiple features. Advanced users have the option to use free feeds (blocklists) across various platforms.

There is a form available for users of ProtonDNS to report any phishing or malicious websites they encounter via Smart Contract and store all reports on blockchain.

Our objective is to enhance the appeal of this feature by implementing a functionality where users can earn $XPR by submitting reports, with each report earning them a certain number of points.

Additionally, users can copy the DNS in either IPv4 form or as a DoH DNS over HTTPS. The process of configuring DNS on any device is quite straightforward, as explained in the following section. DNS is a software-free solution, which implies that users do not have to install any third-party software on their device.

Web3 vanity domains represent a completely new feature, enabling owners of vanity names such as "alvosec.xpr" to turn them into actual local domains that can be used with a browser. The only requirement is to redirect or create an A record with a non-sharable IP address to the desired
destination.

The setup section provides users with a step-by-step guide on how to use ProtonDNS on various devices.

Setting up the service only requires a few simple steps and is entirely software-free, eliminating the need for any additional installations.
We acknowledge that if security measures are overly complex, people may be deterred from using them. Therefore, we prioritize making our service user-friendly and straightforward to use.

*"Security at the expense of usability, comes at the expense of security."*

We also provide digitally signed profile for iOS users which ensures that the profile has not been altered or tampered with. When the profile is installed on an iOS device, the device will verify the digital signature to confirm that the profile is authentic and has not been modified in any way. This helps to prevent unauthorized changes to the profile, which could potentially compromise the security of the device and its data.

### Ecosystem Fit

Our primary goal is to provide a first DNS security solution for the Web3 ecosystem and to raise awareness among all members of the cryptocurrency community. By developing a secure and reliable DNS service that is specifically designed to meet the unique needs of Web3 applications, we aim to set a new standard for online security and privacy in this rapidly evolving space.

### Roadmap

1. **Incorporate additional threat intelligence services** from providers such as Mnemonic, CRDF labs, alphaMountain and Bfore to enhance our capabilities.
2. **Develop a feature that allows users to earn** $XPR by submitting reports, thereby incentivizing community participation and strengthening our threat detection efforts.
3. **Increase the accuracy** of our system by integrating more whitelists, thus reducing false positives.
4. **Create a domain threat intelligence scanner**, which will enable users to identify any suspicious activity on websites they visit.
5. **Produce instructional videos** to educate users about ProtonDNS and how to use its features effectively.
6. **Conduct marketing campaigns** to raise awareness of ProtonDNS and expand our user base.

### Milestones

### Milestone Domain Threat Intelligence

- **Milestone:** 1
- **Estimated duration:** 3-6 month
- **FTE:**  3+
- **Costs:** 20,000 USD

| ID | Deliverable | Specification |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Data Analysis and Model Creation | In this stage, we will gather and analyze approximately 50k phishing domains to identify common patterns that these malicious domains contain. Using this analysis, we will create a model that can identify potential phishing domains based on these patterns. This model will serve as the foundation for our Domain Threat Intelligence system. |
| 2 | Development of Domain Threat Intelligence Web Application | Using the model created in the first stage, we will develop a Domain Threat Intelligence web application that uses machine learning technology to scan any domain across the internet and identify any potential risk factors. The web application will be focused on identifying risky domains that are promoted in Web3. Any user can report a potentially risky domain on blockchain via smart contract and receive a reward in $XPR. |
| 3 | Testing Phase | Before releasing our Domain Threat Intelligence system to the public, we will conduct a thorough testing phase for a certain period of time. This phase will ensure that the system is accurate and reliable, and that any potential issues are identified and addressed before public release. |
| 4 | Public Release | Once the testing phase is complete and any necessary adjustments have been made, we will release our advanced Domain Threat Intelligence solution to the public. This solution will be built on the Proton blockchain and will provide a powerful tool for identifying and reporting potential malicious domains. |
| 5 | Partnership and Marketing | Following the public release of our Domain Threat Intelligence system, we will seek out partnerships and focus on marketing efforts to bring more attention to our solution. Through strategic partnerships with relevant companies and organizations, we can broaden the scope and effectiveness of our solution, ultimately contributing to a safer and more secure experience for Web3 users. |

### Future Plans

Our aim is to enhance all of our services by staying updated at all times and adopting novel approaches to detect websites that may pose a risk.

### Additional Information

It is apparent that services of this nature cannot function without expenses. As a result, we are seeking this grant to cover server costs, expand future development, support marketing efforts, and many more that will come.

As a dedicated team, we always begin a project with a clear understanding of our responsibility to deliver a completed product that satisfies the needs of our users.

Thank you for considering our application for financial support. We appreciate your time and attention to this matter.
